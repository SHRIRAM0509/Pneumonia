# CLASSIFICATION OF CHEST X-RAY IMAGES INTO PNEUMONIA / NORMAL
A model which attempts to classify chest xrays into Pneumonic or Normal.

## **Key facts**

    1. Pneumonia accounts for 15% of all deaths of children under 5 years old, killing 808 694 children in 2017
    2. Pneumonia can be caused by viruses, bacteria, or fungi.
    3. Pneumonia can be prevented by immunization, adequate nutrition, and by addressing environmental factors.
    4. Pneumonia caused by bacteria can be treated with antibiotics, but only one third of children with pneumonia receive the antibiotics they need.

## **Pneumonia - Defined By WHO**

Pneumonia is a form of **acute respiratory infection that affects the lungs**. The lungs are made up of small sacs called alveoli, which fill with air when a healthy person breathes. When an individual has pneumonia, the alveoli are filled with pus and fluid, which makes breathing painful and limits oxygen intake.

Pneumonia is the single largest infectious cause of death in children worldwide. **Pneumonia killed 808 694 children under the age of 5 in 2017**, accounting for 15% of all deaths of children under five years old. Pneumonia affects children and families everywhere, but is **most prevalent in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa**. Children can be protected from pneumonia, it can be prevented with simple interventions, and treated with low-cost, low-tech medication and care.
Causes

Pneumonia is caused by a number of infectious agents, including viruses, bacteria and fungi. The most common are:

    1. Streptococcus pneumoniae – the most common cause of bacterial pneumonia in children;
    2. Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) – the second most common cause of bacterial pneumonia;
    3. respiratory syncytial virus is the most common viral cause of pneumonia;
    4. in infants infected with HIV, Pneumocystis jiroveci is one of the most common causes of pneumonia, responsible for at least one quarter of all pneumonia deaths in HIV-infected infants.

## **Transmission**

Pneumonia can be spread in a number of ways. The viruses and bacteria that are commonly found in a child's nose or throat, can infect the lungs if they are inhaled. They may also spread via air-borne droplets from a cough or sneeze. In addition, pneumonia may spread through blood, especially during and shortly after birth. More research needs to be done on the different pathogens causing pneumonia and the ways they are transmitted, as this is of critical importance for treatment and prevention.
